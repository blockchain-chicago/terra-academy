### Assignment
<i>
Good smart contracts include complete sets of tests. It is best practice to add a test for a feature when you add the feature. Don't let test debt get away from you as you add more and more features without tests â€“ writing the tests will be much more difficult later!
<br/> <br/> 
For now, complete the rustlings section on tests. If you need help, refer to the Rust Book, chapter 11.1.
<br/> <br/> 
Upload your latest rustlings results screenshot.
<br/> <br/> 
Note: CosmWasm's testing library provides extensions for easily testing your CosmWasm contract, including a full mock environment. We introduced these in the Quick Start Contract Walkthrough, and they'll be further covered in future videos.
<br/> <br/> 
CosmWasm also includes a multi-test package which is still early in development. This will bring multi-contract test functionality to local development environments. At this time, it supports contract-to-contract calls (not IBC calls) and Bank calls.
