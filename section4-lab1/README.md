### Assignment
<i>
Finish up the tests in the previous codealong video!
<br/> <br/> 
You're here early. The codealong video just launched, and code upload is still pending. If you want the code, please try again soon:D
<br/> <br/> 
Otherwise, give it a go writing the missing tests as described at the end of the video: 1) a user cannot add an entry for an address that is not their own, and 2) the admin CAN add an address that is not their own.

### Solution
This one is technically not required since the code isn't released (from what I understand), but if you want watch the 50 min video before this and then at the end around 3 mins from very end, look at what he says to do and write the tests. Shouldn't be hard, just couldn't be bothered.
