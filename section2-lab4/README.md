### Assignment
<i>
Before you reach the Rustlings exercises on Result and Option, you need to complete modules, collections, and strings. If you have difficulty, refer to the Rust Book as follows:
<br/> <br/> 
modules	§7.2<br/> 
collections	§8.1, §8.3<br/> 
strings	§8.2<br/> 
These concepts should be familiar to programmers. In particular, knowing how to work with vectors and maps will prove useful to smart contract developers.
<br/> <br/> 
Once you've finished these, complete error handling, generics, and options. If you need additional help here, the book is once again your best friend:
<br/> <br/> 
error_handling	§9<br/> 
generics	§10<br/> 
option	§10.1<br/> 
Post a screenshot of the result of rustlings verify below, showing that you have passed the exercises up through the end of the option section.
